Machine learning coding proposed by apurv verma.

**Data preprocessing** : *Day 1*  


Data preprocessing:First step to get started with machhine learning.

**Step1:** **Importing the required libraries**

1.Numpy

2.Pandas

3.Matplotlib

These three are essential library each time.

Pandas is the library used to import datasets and managing them.

Numpy is the library which contains all the Mathematical functions.

**Step 2:** **Importing the data set**

Data sets are generally availabe in .csv format.It contains data in tabular form.

We use read_csv.md method of pandas library to read the csv file as a dataframe.

Then we make seperate vectors and matrix of dependent variable and independent variables from the dataframe.

**Step3:** **Handling the missing data:**
